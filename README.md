## Graph Convolutional Neural Networks with Data-driven Graph Filter (GCNN-DDGF)

This repository applies the GCNN-DDGF for two traffic-related data prediction studies:

* Network-wide Station-level Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction

* Network-wide Traffic Speed Prediction

### Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction 

Bike-sharing demand data are downloaded from 

### Network-wide Traffic Speed Prediction

We use the same data from the traffic data files for Los Angeles (METR-LA)
